WeeK 7

# Peer assessment #
Bhoowan is the group leader. Other group members  are Haritha, Sanjeevna, Shalini and Ikram.Each member collaborated well to complete the group task and other activities of the week. Sanjeevna is so cooperative and motivating so I wants to rate her 5/5 and other members 4/5.
I want to rate myself 5/5 as this week was so challenging for me .

# Challenges Faced #
There are certain challenges that I encountered this week, such as coding difficulties, time management issues, or project-related obstacles.But my group members helped me a lot to solve such issues.

# What Went Well and Lessons Learned #
I get to know about new concepts such as react app , HTML code converter, editing of the output that browser shows.
Moreover, the most intresting part is that it was easy to create amazing website and webpages by following the steps. I even have memorised some common steps that is a good sign.

# Final Thoughts #
Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in this Course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

# Next Steps #
